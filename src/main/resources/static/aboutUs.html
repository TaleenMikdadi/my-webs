<h>About Us</h>
<p>My name is Taleen Mikdadi and I'm a student that studies programming. This web site is called 
"BuyAndSell Properties", and the goal of this web site is to buy and sell different types of 
properties like: houses, lands, villas, apartments and more. People can create a new account by 
signing up, then they can enter the web site whenever they want through the login page. When you 
enter the web site's home page you'll find a table that contains all the properties that other 
people added, and the table will contain information about the property. Also, you'll see three 
buttons that give you different options: the first button will take you to a page where you can add 
a new property by filling up it's information(Location, Type , Area, Description, Price and 5 Photos), 
the second button will take you to a page where you can delete a property by its id, the third 
button will take you to the web site's "About Us" page.</p>
<p>My future plan of the web site is to help benefit people from it, and to become a world wide web 
site to make it easier for people in real estate trading.</p>
